# PagerDuty API Schemas

This repository contains our OpenAPI defined public APIs.

## Maintenance

The OpenAPI references in this repository are built by a bot from an internal repository. PagerDuty employees will open Pull Requests here only to update our markdown documentation (such as the [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).)

## Contributing

If you'd like to update our OpenAPI references please please open a PR against this repository. 
We will not merge your PR directly, instead we will use the change you provided to update our internal repository which will in turn update this repository.

### Why not open source your internal repository?

Our internal repository contains a plethora of history that we aren't comfortable open sourcing. It also contains schemas for internal APIs and open sourcing those is a security risk.
