# Demo Account

The demo account is a Sandbox account that we use to provide data to the "Try It" feature in the API Reference.

You can spoof into the account here: https://pd-admin.pd-internal.com/accounts/203393

## Fake Data

The data that is populated into this account is manually entered, either through scripts or through the interface.

If you are adding a new data model you have to go and enter the data into the demo account and enter it yourself.

## Theme

The demo account data follows a theme of "Crewed Space Exploration.". There wasn't a whole lot of thought put into this other than that the theme is fairly wide reaching, inclusive, and is easy to find relevant information on.
