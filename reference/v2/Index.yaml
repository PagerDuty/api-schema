    This document describes the PagerDuty REST APIs.

    For guides and examples please visit our [Documentation.](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/get-started/getting-started/)

    Our REST APIs are defined in OpenAPI v3.x. You can view the schema at [github.com/PagerDuty/api-schema](https://github.com/PagerDuty/api-schema).

    Note that properties in some schemas have fields not shown by default such as `readOnly`, `format`, and `default`. Hover your cursor over the right column that looks like `optional+1` to see the full list of fields.

tags:
  - name: Abilities
    description: |
      This describes your account's abilities by feature name. For example `"teams"`.
      An ability may be available to your account based on things like your pricing plan or account state.
  - name: Add-ons
    description: |
      Developers can write their own functionality to insert into PagerDuty's UI.
  - name: Analytics
    description: |
      Provides enriched incident data.
  - name: Audit
    description: |
      Provides audit record data.
  - name: Paused Incident Reports
    description: |
      Provides paused Incident reporting data on services and accounts that have paused Alerts.
  - name: Business Services
    description: |
      Business services model capabilities that span multiple technical services and that may be owned by several different teams.
  - name: Change Events
    description: |
      Change Events enable you to send informational events about recent changes such as code deploys and system config changes from any system that can make an outbound HTTP connection. These events do not create incidents and do not send notifications; they are shown in context with incidents on the same PagerDuty service.
  - name: Escalation Policies
    description: |
      Escalation policies define which user should be alerted at which time.
  - name: Event Orchestrations
    description: |
      Event Orchestrations allow you to route events to an endpoint and create collections of Event Orchestrations, which define sets of actions to take based on event content.
  - name: Extension Schemas
    description: |
      A PagerDuty extension vendor represents a specific type of outbound extension such as Generic Webhook, Slack, ServiceNow.
  - name: Extensions
    description: |
      Extensions are representations of Extension Schema objects that are attached to Services.
  - name: Incidents
    description: |
      An incident represents a problem or an issue that needs to be addressed and resolved. Incidents trigger on a service, which prompts notifications to go out to on-call responders per the service's escalation policy.
  - name: Log Entries
    description: |
      A log of all the events that happen to an Incident, and these are exposed as Log Entries.
  - name: Maintenance Windows
    description: |
      A Maintenance Window is used to temporarily disable one or more Services for a set period of time.
  - name: Notifications
    description: |
      A Notification is created when an Incident is triggered or escalated.
  - name: On-Calls
    description: |
      An on-call represents a contiguous unit of time for which a User will be on call for a given Escalation Policy and Escalation Rules
  - name: Priorities
    description: |
      A priority is a label representing the importance and impact of an incident. This feature is only available on Standard and Enterprise plans.
  - name: Response Plays
    description: |
      Response Plays are a package of Incident Actions that can be applied during an Incident's life cycle.
  - name: Rulesets
    description: |
      Rulesets allow you to route events to an endpoint and create collections of Event Rules, which define sets of actions to take based on event content.
  - name: Schedules
    description: |
      A Schedule determines the time periods that users are On-Call.
  - name: Service Dependencies
    description: |
      Services are categorized into technical and business services. Dependencies can be created via any combination of these services.
  - name: Services
    description: |
      A Service may represent an application, component, or team you wish to open incidents against.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: |
      A webhook is a way to receive events that occur on the PagerDuty platform via an HTTP POST request.
      V3 webhooks are set up by creating a webhook subscription.
  - name: Status Dashboards
    description: |
      Status Dashboards represent user-defined views for the Status Dashboard product that are limited to specific Business Services rather than the whole set of top-level Business Services (those with no dependent Services).
  - name: Tags
    description: |
      A Tag is applied to Escalation Policies, Teams or Users and can be used to filter them.
  - name: Teams
    description: |
      A team is a collection of Users and Escalation Policies that represent a group of people within an organization.
  - name: Users
    description: |
      Users are members of a PagerDuty account that have the ability to interact with Incidents and other data on the account.
  - name: Vendors
    description: |
      A PagerDuty Vendor represents a specific type of integration. AWS Cloudwatch, Splunk, Datadog are all examples of vendors

        Provides aggregated metrics for incidents aggregated into units of time by service.

        Example metrics include Seconds to Resolve, Seconds to Engage, Snoozed Seconds, and Sleep Hour Interruptions. Some metric definitions can be found in our [Knowledge Base](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/pagerduty-analytics).
        Data can be aggregated by day, week or month in addition to by service, or provided just as a collection of aggregates for each service in the dataset for the entire period.  If a unit is provided, each row in the returned dataset will include a 'range_start' timestamp.

        Provides aggregated metrics for incidents aggregated into units of time by team.

        Example metrics include Seconds to Resolve, Seconds to Engage, Snoozed Seconds, and Sleep Hour Interruptions. Some metric definitions can be found in our [Knowledge Base](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/pagerduty-analytics).
        Data can be aggregated by day, week or month in addition to by team, or provided just as a collection of aggregates for each team in the dataset for the entire period.  If a unit is provided, each row in the returned dataset will include a 'range_start' timestamp.

The Router evaluates Events you send to this Orchestration against each of its rules, one at a time, and routes the event to a specific Service based on the first rule that matches. If an event doesn't match any rules, it'll be sent to service specified in as the `catch_all` or the "Unrouted" Orchestration if no service is specified.

        List related Change Events for an Incident, as well as the reason these changes are correlated with the incident.

        Change events represent service changes such as deploys, build completion, and configuration changes, providing information that is critical during incident triage or hypercare. For more information on change events, see [Change Events](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/change-events).

        The Change Correlation feature provides incident responders with recent change events that are most relevant to that incident. Change Correlation informs the responder why a particular change event was surfaced and correlated to an incident based on three key factors which include time, related service, or intelligence (machine learning).

        Create a new Event Rule.

        Rulesets allow you to route events to an endpoint and create collections of Event Rules, which define sets of actions to take based on event content.

        For more information see the [API Concepts Document](../../api-reference/ZG9jOjI3NDc5Nzc-api-concepts#rulesets)

        Note: Create and Update on rules will accept 'description' or 'summary' interchangeably as an extraction action target. Get and List on rules will always return 'summary' as the target. If you are expecting 'description' please change your automation code to expect 'summary' instead.

        Create one or more overrides, each for a specific user covering a specified time range. If you create an override on top of an existing override, the last created override will have priority.

        A Schedule determines the time periods that users are On-Call.

        Note: An older implementation of this endpoint only supported creating a single ocverride per request. That functionality is still supported, but deprecated and may be removed in the future.

        Remove an override.

        You cannot remove a past override.

        If the override start time is before the current time, but the end time is after the current time, the override will be truncated to the current time.

        If the override is truncated, the status code will be 200 OK, as opposed to a 204 No Content for a successful delete.

        A Schedule determines the time periods that users are On-Call.

        Create a new service.

        If `status` is included in the request, it must have a value of `active` when creating a new service. If a different status is required, make a second request to update the service.

        A service may represent an application, component, or team you wish to open incidents against.

        There is a limit of 25,000 services per account. If the limit is reached, the API will respond with an error. There is also a limit of 100,000 open Incidents per Service. If the limit is reached and `auto_resolve_timeout` is disabled (set to 0 or null), the `auto_resolve_timeout` property will automatically be set to  84600 (1 day).

        Succeeds only if the team has no associated Escalation Policies, Services, Schedules and Subteams.

        All associated unresovled incidents will be reassigned to another team (if specified) or will loose team association, thus becoming account-level (with visibility implications).

        Note that the incidents reassignment process is asynchronous and has no guarantee to complete before the API call return.

        A team is a collection of Users and Escalation Policies that represent a group of people within an organization.

        Returns 400 if the user has assigned incidents unless your [pricing plan](https://www.pagerduty.com/pricing) has the `offboarding` feature and the account is [configured](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/offboarding#section-additional-configurations) appropriately.

        Note that the incidents reassignment process is asynchronous and has no guarantee to complete before the api call return.

        [*Learn more about `offboarding` feature*](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/offboarding).
